<h2> The foundation runs various programs such as "The NGO Feeding Program" to support NGOs running residential
 programs with their monthly grocery requirements, "Food Rescue Program" to prevent food wastage, "School Feeding Program" and "Food Relief Programs"
 in emergency situations.
 Thanks to the efforts of our benefactor donors.</h2>

<ul><li><h2>Food rescue, also called food recovery, food salvage or surplus food redistribution,
 is the practice of gleaning edible food that would otherwise go to waste from places such as farms, produce markets,
grocery stores, restaurants, or dining facilities and distributing it to local emergency food programs.</h2></li>
<li><h2>In a world where approximately 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted each year,
 and between 691 and 783 million people face hunger, 
the disconnect between surplus and scarcity is glaringly evident. Food rescue, a process that involves collecting and redistributing surplus food to those experiencing food insecurity, 
emerges as a powerful solution to this paradox.</h2></li>
 <li><h2>This not only addresses immediate hunger but also tackles the environmental toll of wasted food,
 a critical player in the unfolding climate crisis.</h2></li>
